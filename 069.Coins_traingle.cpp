/*
if we observe the question and the test cases carefully, we can observe that they had given the value based on the formula n * (n + 1) / 2 that means sum of n natural numbers formula.
they have given that total sum, we need to find that n value.
in the constraints they gave that a[i] may range upto 1e9.
so :  
(44,721Ã—44,722) / 2 = 1,000,036,282 ( > 1e9), 

44721 x 44722 = 2 x 1,000,036,282 ( > 1e9), sp we can make it round figure, as 45000 and perform upto that limit.

so i took a loop uoto 45000, which satisfies the condition of n * (n + 1 ) / 2 should be less than or equal to given n value.
The point where it gets larger is the point where we need to break the loop, and print the before position of it.
