# 3432. Count Partitions with Even Sum Difference
- [Problem link from Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-partitions-with-even-sum-difference/description/)
## Question
You are given an integer array nums of length n.

A partition is defined as an index i where 0 <= i < n - 1, splitting the array into two non-empty subarrays such that:

Left subarray contains indices [0, i].
Right subarray contains indices [i + 1, n - 1].
Return the number of partitions where the difference between the sum of the left and right subarrays is even.
## Example 1:
- Input: nums = [10,10,3,7,6]
- Output: 4
- Explanation:
- The 4 partitions are:

    - [10], [10, 3, 7, 6] with a sum difference of 10 - 26 = -16, which is even.
    - [10, 10], [3, 7, 6] with a sum difference of 20 - 16 = 4, which is even.
    - [10, 10, 3], [7, 6] with a sum difference of 23 - 13 = 10, which is even.
    - [10, 10, 3, 7], [6] with a sum difference of 30 - 6 = 24, which is even.
## Example 2:
- Input: nums = [1,2,2]
- Output: 0
- Explanation:
- No partition results in an even sum difference.
## Example 3:
- Input: nums = [2,4,6,8]
- Output: 3
- Explanation:
- All partitions result in an even sum difference.
## Constraints:
- 2 <= n == nums.length <= 100
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 100
## Code in cpp:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countPartitions(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector <int> pre(nums.size());
        pre[0] = nums[0];
        int cnt = 0;
        //prefix sum
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            pre[i] = pre[i - 1] + nums[i];
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; i++) {
            int val1 = pre[i];
            int val2 = pre[nums.size() - 1] - pre[i];
            if (!(abs(val1 - val2) & 1)) cnt++;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
