# 2595. Number of Even and Odd Bits
- [Problem link from Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-even-and-odd-bits/description/)
## Question
## [Easy] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accuracy(72 %)
You are given a positive integer n.

Let even denote the number of even indices in the binary representation of n with value 1.

Let odd denote the number of odd indices in the binary representation of n with value 1.

Note that bits are indexed from right to left in the binary representation of a number.

Return the array [even, odd].
## Example 1:
- Input: n = 50
- Output: [1,2]
- Explanation: The binary representation of 50 is 110010. It contains 1 on indices 1, 4, and 5.
## Example 2:
- Input: n = 2
- Output: [0,1]
- Explanation: The binary representation of 2 is 10. It contains 1 only on index 1.
## Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 1000
## Code in cpp:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> evenOddBit(int n) {
        vector <int> ans(2);
        string val = "";
        while (n > 0) {
            val += to_string(n % 2);
            n /= 2;
        }
        vector <int> ind;
        for (int i = 0; i < val.size(); i++) {
            if (val[i] == '1') ind.push_back(i);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < ind.size(); i++) {
            if (ind[i] & 1) ans[1]++;
            else ans[0]++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
