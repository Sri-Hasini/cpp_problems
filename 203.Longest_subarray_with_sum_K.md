## *[Medium problem] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accuracy(24%)*
## **Question**
Given an array arr[] containing integers and an integer k, your task is to find the length of the longest subarray where the sum of its elements is equal to the given value k. If there is no subarray with sum equal to k, return 0.

## **Algorithms / Intuitions**
1. **[Naive Approach - Brute force] Using Nested Loop – O(n^2) Time and O(1) Space** :
<pre>
- Here, in this approach, we are going to generate all possible subarrays to solve this problem.
- How to generate all possible subarrays?
- We will select all possible starting indices(say i) and all possible ending indices(say j) to generate all possible subarrays.
- The possible starting indices i.e. i can vary from index 0 to index n-1(i.e. The last index).
- For every index i, the possible ending index j can vary from i to n-1. 

Approach:
<pre>
The steps are as follows:
- First, we will run a loop(say i) that will select every possible starting index of the subarray. The possible starting indices can vary from index 0 to index n-1(n = size of the array).
- Inside the loop, we will run another loop(say j) that will signify the ending index of the subarray. For every subarray starting from the index i, the possible ending index can vary from index i to n-1(n = size of the array).
- After that for each subarray starting from index i and ending at index j (i.e. arr[i….j]), we will run another loop to calculate the sum of all the elements(of that particular subarray).
- If the sum is equal to k, we will consider its length i.e. (j-i+1). Among all such subarrays, we will consider the maximum length by comparing all the lengths.
</pre>
Intuition:
<pre>- We will check the sum of every possible subarray and consider the one with the sum k and the maximum length among them. 
- To get every possible subarray sum, we will be using three nested loops. The first loops(say i and j) will iterate over every possible starting index and ending index of a subarray. 
- Basically, in each iteration, the subarray range will be from index i to index j. 
- Using another loop we will get the sum of the elements of the subarray [i…..j]. 
- Among all the subarrays with sum k, we will consider the one with the maximum length.

**Note :** We are selecting every possible subarray using two nested loops and for each of them, we add all its elements using another loop.
</pre>
Complexity analysis : 
<pre>**Time Complexity:** O(N3) approx., where N = size of the array.
**Reason:** We are using three nested loops, each running approximately N times.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) as we are not using any extra space.
</pre>
</pre>
2. **[Expected Approach] Using Hash Map and Prefix Sum – O(n) Time and O(n) Space** :
<pre>&nbsp; - If you take a closer look at this problem, this is mainly an extension of Longest Subarray with 0 sum.
&nbsp; - The idea is based on the fact that if Sj – Si = k (where Si and Sj are prefix sums till index i and j respectively, and  i < j), then the subarray between i+1 to j has sum equal to k. 
&nbsp; - For example, arr[] = [5, 2, -3, 4, 7] and k = 3.  The value of S3 – S0= 3,  it means the subarray from index 1 to 3 has sum equals to 3. 
&nbsp; - So we mainly compute prefix sums in the array and store these prefix sums in a hash table. And check if current prefix sum – k is already present. 
         If current prefix sum – k is present in the hash table and is mapped to index j, then subarray from j to current index has sum equal to k.

&nbsp; - Below are the main points to consider in your implementation.
&nbsp;    ~ If we have the whole prefix having sum equal to k, we should prefer it as it would be the longest possible till that point.
&nbsp;    ~ If there are multiple occurrences of a prefixSum, we must store index of the earliest occurrence of prefixSum because we need to find the longest subarray.</pre>

            prefix[i] = arr[i] + prefix[i - 1];
