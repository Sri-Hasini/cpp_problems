The tech fest of IIT Ropar, Advitiya, has a talent show as part of the festivities.
The preliminary round of the talent show has participants being evaluated by 5 judges, and only those participants whose performance was liked by at least 4 judges will qualify for the next round.
Anuj participated in the talent show, and now wants to know if he'll qualify or not. You are given the responses of all 5 judges â€” help Anuj decide whether he qualified!
Each judge's response is given to you as a binary integer, where:
0 means the judge didn't like Anuj's performance.
1 means the judge liked Anuj's performance.
