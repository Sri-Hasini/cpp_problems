# Food balance
- [Problem from Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/problems/FOODBAL)
## Question (215)
Chef is preparing to cook his dinner. There are two dishes Chef can make. The first one contains F1 grams of fat and P1 grams of protein, while the second contains F2 grams of fat and P2 grams of protein.
Chef would like the quantity of fats and proteins he consumes to be as close to each other as possible, i.e., the absolute difference between the amount of fats and proteins should be as small as possible.
Help Chef by telling him which dish he'll choose; or if both dishes have the same difference.

**Input Format:**

The first and only line of input contains four space-separated integers F1, P1, F2 and P2 — the quantities of fat and protein in the first dish and second dish, respectively.

**Output Format:**

Output a single string:
- "First" (without quotes) if Chef will choose the first dish.
- "Second" (without quotes) if Chef will choose the second dish.
- "Both" (without quotes) if both dishes are equivalent.
- Each character of the output may be in either uppercase or lowercase, i.e. if the answer is Both, then any of the strings BOTH, both, Both, bOTh, and so on will be accepted.

**Constraints:**

1 ≤ F1 , P1, F2, P2 ≤ 100

**Sample 1:**
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Input</th>
    <th>Output</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>30 40 35 44</td>
    <td>Second</td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Explanation:**

The first dish has a difference of ∣30−40∣=10 between its fats and proteins, while the second dish has a difference of ∣35−44∣=9.
Chef will choose the second dish, since it has a smaller difference.

**Sample 2:**
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Input</th>
    <th>Output</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>31 100 100 1</td>
    <td>Both</td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Explanation:**

The first dish has a difference of ∣1−100∣=99 between its fats and proteins, while the second dish has a difference of ∣100−1∣=99.
Both dishes have the same difference.

**Sample 3:**
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Input</th>
    <th>Output</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>58 56 38 52</td>
    <td>First</td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Explanation:**

The first dish has a difference of ∣58−56∣=2 between its fats and proteins, while the second dish has a difference of ∣38−52∣=14.
Chef will choose the first dish, since it has a smaller difference.

## Approach
The question was only asked to return which pair of fats and protiens is having minimum difference between them... so we can just use ternary operator for that, if both are equal then we can return both

## Code in cpp
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a, b, c, d;
    cin >> a >> b >> c >> d;
    (abs(a - b) < abs(c - d)) ? cout << "First" : ((abs(a - b) > abs(c - d)) ? cout << "Second" : cout << "Both");
}
```
