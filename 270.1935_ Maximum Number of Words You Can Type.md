# 1935. Maximum Number of Words You Can Type
- [Problem link from Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-words-you-can-type/)
## Question
There is a malfunctioning keyboard where some letter keys do not work. All other keys on the keyboard work properly.

Given a string text of words separated by a single space (no leading or trailing spaces) and a string brokenLetters of all distinct letter keys that are broken, return the number of words in text you can fully type using this keyboard.
## Example 1:
- Input: text = "hello world", brokenLetters = "ad"
- Output: 1
- Explanation: We cannot type "world" because the 'd' key is broken.
## Example 2:
- Input: text = "leet code", brokenLetters = "lt"
- Output: 1
- Explanation: We cannot type "leet" because the 'l' and 't' keys are broken.
## Example 3:
- Input: text = "leet code", brokenLetters = "e"
- Output: 0
- Explanation: We cannot type either word because the 'e' key is broken.
## Constraints:
- 1 <= text.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
- 0 <= brokenLetters.length <= 26
- text consists of words separated by a single space without any leading or trailing spaces.
- Each word only consists of lowercase English letters.
- brokenLetters consists of distinct lowercase English letters.
## Code in cpp:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int canBeTypedWords(string text, string brokenLetters) {
        vector <string> a;
        string s;
        for (int i = 0; i < text.size(); i++) {
            if (text[i] == ' ') {
                a.push_back(s);
                s = "";
            }
            else s += text[i];
        }
        a.push_back(s);
        int output = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < a.size(); i++) {
            int cnt = 0;
            cout << a[i] << endl;
            for (int j = 0; j < a[i].size(); j++) {
                if (brokenLetters.find(a[i][j]) == string::npos) {
                    cnt++;
                }
            }
            if (cnt == a[i].size()) output++;
        }
        return output;
    }
};
```
