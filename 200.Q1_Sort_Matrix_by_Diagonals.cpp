//Q1. Sort Matrix by Diagonals - leetcode (medium) (acc : 72%)
//https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-matrix-by-diagonals/description/
/*
You are given an n x n square matrix of integers grid. Return the matrix such that:
The diagonals in the bottom-left triangle (including the middle diagonal) are sorted in non-increasing order.
The diagonals in the top-right triangle are sorted in non-decreasing order.
Note: Please do not copy the description during the contest to maintain the integrity of your submissions.

Input: grid = [[1,7,3],[9,8,2],[4,5,6]]
Output: [[8,2,3],[9,6,7],[4,5,1]]Â©leetcode
