## Question
## [Medium] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accuracy(20 %)
Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.

The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

- Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (" ").
- Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity if neither present.
- Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.
- Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be rounded to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be rounded to 231 - 1.

Return the integer as the final result.

## Example 1:
- Input: s = "42"
- Output: 42
- Explanation:
  - The underlined characters are what is read in and the caret is the current reader position.
  - Step 1: "42" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
             ^
  - Step 2: "42" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
             ^
  - Step 3: "42" ("42" is read in)
              ^
## Example 2:
- Input: s = " -042"
- Output: -42
- Explanation:
  - Step 1: "   -042" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
                ^
  - Step 2: "   -042" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
                 ^
  - Step 3: "   -042" ("042" is read in, leading zeros ignored in the result)
                   ^
## Example 3:
- Input: s = "1337c0d3"
- Output: 1337
- Explanation:
  - Step 1: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
             ^
  - Step 2: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
             ^
  - Step 3: "1337c0d3" ("1337" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
                 ^
## Example 4:
- Input: s = "0-1"
- Output: 0
- Explanation:
  - Step 1: "0-1" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
             ^
  - Step 2: "0-1" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
             ^
  - Step 3: "0-1" ("0" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
              ^
## Example 5:
- Input: s = "words and 987"
- Output: 0
- Explanation:
Reading stops at the first non-digit character 'w'.

## Constraints:
- 0 <= s.length <= 200
- s consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (0-9), ' ', '+', '-', and '.'.

## Approach
- To ensure that the string doesnt have any white spaces, iterate starting if you found white spaces and if not, store that index and break
- Create an empty string to store the answer and also a boolean sign variable and initialize it with false
- Check if that stored index value equals '-' sign, if yes keep true in the sign variable and increment the stored index 
- Other wise , if it is '+' sign, just increment the stored index 
- Now, the process begins by checking if that value at the stored index is between '0' and '9', if yes we can process until we go either less than '0' or greater than '9
- If such condition like going out of range occurs, then just break it , or else just append that value to the answer variable
- After doing all these, check if the answer variable's size is 0, that means we did not encountered any value, so return 0 directly
- Now keep a variable called "value" as long long and initialize it with 0
- Iterate over the answer variable and store the value = value * 10 + (ans[i] - '0) {ans[i] - '0' used because it is a character and we need to convert it to integer so we can do this directly}
- Now, check the overflow condition, if the sign variable is true, means it is negative number and we need to check by multiplying it with -1 like (-1 * value <= INT_MIN) if yes, return INT_MIN
- check same with positive one like (value >= INT_MAX) if yes, return INT_MAX
- or else if the above doesnt happen and the number doesnt got overflow, write at the bottom if the sign is true, return (-1 * value) or else return value directly
## Code in cpp
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int myAtoi(string s) {
        int ind = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            if (s[i] != ' ') {
                ind = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        string ans = "";
        bool sign = false;
        if (s[ind] == '-') {
            sign = true;
            ind++;
        }
        else if (s[ind] == '+') ind++;
        if (s[ind] >= '0' && s[ind] <= '9') {
            for (int i = ind; i < s.size(); i++) {
                if (s[i] < '0' || s[i] > '9') {
                    break;
                }
                ans += s[i];
            }
        }
        if (ans.size() == 0) return 0;
        long long value = 0;//to avoid overflow for int we stored in long long 
        for (int i = 0; i < ans.size(); i++) {
            value = value * 10 + (ans[i] - '0');
            //checking for overflow conditions
            if (sign) {
                if (value * -1 <= INT_MIN) return INT_MIN;
            }
            else {
                if (value >= INT_MAX) return INT_MAX;
            }
        }
        return (sign) ? -1 * value : value;
    }
};
