# S to T
- [Codechef contest question](https://www.codechef.com/problems/STOT)
## Aapproach:
As the question was said that if s[i - 1] is '1' then only we can flip the s[i] bit if it is not equals to h[i]

so, we need to first check whether our first bits in both the strings are equal or not, if not print -1, orelse, check if our strings are equal, if yes, print 0, as no operations are required...

orelse check if the first 1's from both the strings are at same index, if not print -1, or else store that 1'st 1's position of string s in another variable ind1

declare an answer array to store answer, then, run a loop from the ind1 + 1 upto n - 1 and keep all places as '1' if it is '0' and push that indices to our answer array

and then run a loop from n -1 to ind1 + 1 and keep h[i] in s[i] if they are not equal and push those indices to our answer array...

if our s and h are equal, then print all of them, otherwise print -1
## Code in cpp:
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        string s, h;
        cin >> s;
        cin >> h;
        if (s[0] != h[0]) {
            cout << -1 << endl;
            continue;
        }
        if (s == h) {
            cout << 0 << endl;
            continue;
        }
        vector <int> ans;
        int ind1 = 0, ind2 = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            if (s[i] == '1') {
                ind1 = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < h.size(); i++) {
            if (h[i] == '1') {
                ind2 = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (ind1 != ind2) cout << -1 << endl;
        else {
            vector <int> ans;
            for (int i = ind1 + 1; i < n; i++) {
                if (s[i] == '0') {
                    s[i] = '1';
                    ans.push_back(i);
                }
            }
            
            for (int i = n - 1; i > ind1; i--) {
                if (s[i] != h[i]) {
                    s[i] = h[i];
                    ans.push_back(i);
                }
            }
            
            if (s == h) {
                cout << ans.size() << endl;
                for (int i = 0; i < ans.size(); i++) cout << ans[i] << " ";
                cout << endl;
            }
            else cout << -1 << endl;
        }
    }
}
