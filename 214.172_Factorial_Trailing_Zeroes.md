# 172. Factorial Trailing Zeroes
- [Problem link from Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/factorial-trailing-zeroes/description/)
## Question
## [Medium] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accuracy(44 %)
Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.

Note that n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1.
## Example 1:
- Input: n = 3
- Output: 0
- Explanation: 3! = 6, no trailing zero.
## Example 2:
- Input: n = 5
- Output: 1
- Explanation: 5! = 120, one trailing zero.
## Example 3:
- Input: n = 0
- Output: 0
## Constraints:
- 0 <= n <= 104
- Follow up: Could you write a solution that works in logarithmic time complexity?
## Code in cpp:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            n /= 5;
            res += n;
        }
        return res;
        // When we get a number, to check if has trailing zeroes then we can start with
        // no.of 10's == no. of trailing zeroes
        // this wont work, as we will have to calculate the value of n!, which is very very large
        // So we start with 10, it can be written as 10 = 2*5
        // when writing the no.of 2's and 5's in a number, we can say that
        // the least freq of 2,5 is the no. of trailing zeroes i.e., min(2's count, 5's count)
        // but we need to calculate for factorial
        // in factorial, the (no. of 2's) and (no of 5's) will be greater, because if the n value is
        // greater than 2, then 2's count also increases for eg: 4! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 which is 
        // while writing in primes... 1 * 2 * 3 * (2 * 2), so the count of 2's are 3
        // but 4! is 24, which doesnt have any trailing zeros, same in the case of 5, the numbers which 
        // are larger than 5, or larger than 2, will definitely have more 5's and 2's respectively
        // So, based on our intuition so far.
        // If n=5  ... there will be 1(5)
        // If n=10 ... there will be 2(5's) 
        //             i.e., 1 * 2 * 3 * (2 * 2) * 5 * (2 * 3) * 7 * (2 * 2 * 2) * (3 * 3) * (2 * 5)
        //             2's count is 8, 5's count is 2
        // If n=15 ... there will be 3(5's)
        // If n=25 ... there will be 5(5's) + 1(5)
        // Now all we need to do is keep dividing n by 5 and add the result 
        // to our existing result until n get to 0.
    }
};
```
